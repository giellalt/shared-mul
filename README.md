# giellalt/shared-mul: Shared multilingual linguistic resources

This repository contains shared linguistic resources usable for GiellaLT infra:

* URLs in a self-contained lexc lexicon
* punctuations and symbols in lexc lexicon to be converted and included as a
  part of morphology

This repo is optional but recommended data for building of the most of the
`giellalt/langs-*` modules. It will be automatically picked up if located in
standard location or installed (this functionality is currently
work-in-progress).

This repo has been historically split off of `giellalt/giella-shared/all_langs`,
the commit history is mostly retained where possible.
